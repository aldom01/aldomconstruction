In the working world, people try to use our sprinklers to water their
own grass all the time. This may come in the form of a boss who puts
you on a committee for her pet project, a colleague who asks for your
input on a report or presentation or proposal she hasn’t taken the time to
perfect yet herself, or a colleague who stops you in the hallway and talks
your ear off when you have an important meeting to get to or a vital
phone call to make or critical work on your desk.
Whoever it is that’s trying to siphon off your time and energies for
their own purpose, the only solution is to put up fences. And not at the
moment the request is made you need to put up your fences well in
advance, clearly demarcating what’s off limits so you can head off time
wasters and boundary pushers at the pass. Remember, forcing these
people to solve their own problems is equally beneficial for you and for
them.

There's no joy for the writer in such work, and certainly none
for the reader. It's language out of Star Trek, and if I were an
employee I wouldn't be cheered or informed by these efforts
to raise my morale. I would stop reading them. I told the corporate writers they had to find the people behind the fine achievements being described. "Go to the engineer who conceived the
new system," I said, "or to the designer who designed it, or to the
technician who assembled it, and get them to tell you in their
own words how the idea came to them, or how they put it
together, or how it will be used by real people in the real world."
The way to warm up any institution is to locate the missing "I."
Remember: "I" is the most interesting element in any story.

Unfortunately for writers, humor is elusive and subjective.
No two people think the same things are funny, and a piece that
one magazine will reject as a dud is often published by another
that finds it a jewel. The reasons for rejection are equally elusive. "It just doesn't work," editors say, and there's not much
they can add. Occasionally such a piece can be made to work
it has some flaw that can be repaired. Mortality, however, is
high. "Humor can be dissected, as a frog can," E. B. White once
wrote, "but the thing dies in the process and the innards are dis-
couraging to any but the pure scientific mind."
I'm no fancier of dead frogs, but I wanted to see if at least a
few lessons could be learned by poking about in the innards,
and when I was teaching at Yale I decided, one year, to teach a
course in humor writing. I warned my students that possibly it
couldn't be done and that we might end up killing the thing we
loved. Luckily, humor not only didn't die; it bloomed in the
desert of solemn term papers, and I repeated the course the fol
lowing year. Let me briefly reconstruct our journey.
